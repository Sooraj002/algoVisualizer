## Abstract

In computer science education, understanding algorithm behavior and performance is crucial yet challenging for students. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to effectively demonstrate how algorithms manipulate data in real-time. The "CLI-Based Algorithm Visualization System" addresses this challenge by providing a terminal-based visualization tool that demonstrates popular sorting and searching algorithms through dynamic, step-by-step visual representations. Using C programming language, this project implements a lightweight yet powerful system that helps users understand algorithm mechanics without the overhead of graphical interfaces. By visualizing algorithm operations in real-time using ASCII art and ANSI color codes, this system offers an educational tool that works on virtually any terminal, making it highly accessible and practical for learning purposes.

## Introduction

Algorithm visualization is a powerful educational tool that bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. While many existing visualization tools rely on graphical interfaces, there's a significant advantage to using command-line interfaces (CLI) for algorithm visualization: they're lightweight, universal, and focus purely on the algorithm's mechanics. This project creates a CLI-based visualization system that demonstrates how different algorithms work through terminal-based animations.

The system will initially focus on fundamental sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, with the potential to expand to more complex algorithms. By using ASCII characters and ANSI color codes, the system creates clear, real-time visualizations of how algorithms manipulate data, making it easier for students to understand algorithm behavior and performance characteristics.

## Objectives of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Visualization Clarity: Create clear, step-by-step visualizations of algorithm operations using terminal-based graphics and color coding.

2. Educational Value: Provide an interactive learning tool that helps users understand algorithm mechanics and behavior patterns.

3. Performance Analysis: Implement real-time display of operation counts and time complexity to help users understand algorithm efficiency.

4. Accessibility: Develop a system that runs on any terminal without requiring special graphics capabilities or external dependencies.

5. Code Quality: Maintain clean, well-documented code that can serve as an educational resource itself.
